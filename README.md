## üìù Description

Welcome to LiveDocs! An enhanced version of Google Docs that enables real-time collaboration with secure authentication, markdown editing, nested comments, live cursors, and instant notifications.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Collaborative Editing:** Multiple users can edit documents simultaneously with live cursors showing exactly what collaborators are working on. Changes are synchronized instantly across all connected clients without conflicts.

- **Nested Comments System:** A sophisticated commenting system that allows users to select text and add floating comments, tag other users, add emoji reactions, and create nested reply threads. Comments can be resolved, edited, or deleted, providing a complete collaboration workflow.

- **Permission-Based Sharing:** A flexible sharing system that allows document owners to invite specific users as either editors or viewers. The system includes email notifications when access is granted and a user interface for managing collaborator permissions.
